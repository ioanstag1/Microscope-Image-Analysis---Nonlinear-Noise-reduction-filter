# Microscope-Image-Analysis---Nonlinear-Noise-reduction-filter
This repository is related to Computer Vision course purposes at ECE, DUTH.


In this particular project, I worked on the creation and application of a nonlinear noise rejection filter and analyzed the structure of microscope image content (detecting cells, measuring cell surface area, designing and measuring the area of the surrounding box, and finally calculating the average gray level value of the pixels contained in the box environment).
